    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds New York strip steak, sliced thin</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sliced beef in a large bowl. Whisk together lemon juice, soy sauce, sugar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl; pour over beef and toss to coat. 
            Stir in cornstarch. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour to overnight. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove beef slices from marinade, shaking to remove any excess liquid. Discard marinade. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Working in batches, fry beef slices in hot oil until they start to firm and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 
            2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer beef slices to a serving platter. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is golden brown, 
            5 to 7 minutes; spoon over beef slices. 
        </li>      
    </ol>
